Hello there, Application Reader! (Hi again, again to Scriptone if you're reading mine again, again.)

In this repository, you'll find two scripts. They're both the same. Just one has an essay worth of comments explaining the code and the other one doesn't so you can actually read it lol.
I also don't know HOW detailed you guys want the explanation, so I kind of went all out (might be an understatement... or an overstatement).
So, if you want, just read through the code in the one without comments, and if you want my explanation for a part of the code, look at the one with the comments.
Also, I have made the game open to edit. So, if you want, you can edit the game and look at the scripts in there (both commented and uncommented are there). The scripts are in StarterCharacterScripts.
Github kinda messes up the comments because of the way I did them. Unless you make the indentation space 4 (which makes them look fine), I suggest looking at the code in Roblox.

I had no clue what Guard Clauses were before doing research. I found a great video about it on a Roblox DevForm:

I realized I've seen them in other people's code after I learned about them and I always wondered "Why?" (again...; never bothering to find an answer lol).
It's just for readability (and can prevent errors from occurring). To be honest, huge indentation/deep nesting never bothered me that much. This did make my code more pleasant on the eyes though.
I HOPE I have finally fixed everything. Though, it's been pretty fun learning this stuff (pretty fun learning how bad my code is lol; I even wondered why I used :FindFirstChild() the way I did in some spots...).
